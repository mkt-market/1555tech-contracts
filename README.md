# 1155tech

The protocol allows to create arbitrary shares where the pricing is based on an arbitrary bonding curve and fee structure.
Individual shares can be minted (and redeemed again) to an ERC1155 token for a fee.
The creator, platform, and holders (that did not mint an ERC1155 token) earn the accumulated fees.
